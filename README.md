# Joint Limits

This repo contains the source code for all the demos from [this article](https://theorangeduck.com/page/joint-limits).

It uses [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) or more specifically [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) so if you have that installed it should be easy to play around and out.

## Notes

I fork this repo to add thoes features:

- Supports Windows(use premake5 build tool and vs2022)
- More C++ styles(in progress...)
